# Velocimeter

Velocimeter frontend is completely inspired by Original Solidly v1 frontend UI. However, everything is refactored to use typescript in strict mode. It also introduces Tailwind CSS for styling. Some of the legacy components can be found under the legacy folder.
And many-many more fixes and improvements.

## 🏎️ &nbsp; Quickstart

Velocimeter relies on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), React, [VIEM](viem.sh), [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/), [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction) and [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
It also uses Web3-React and FLUX which we want to move away from to WAGMI and Zustand. We also plan to use React Query for data fetching.

## 💻 &nbsp; Developer Experience

### Commands

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

### Configuration

Code quality is set up for you with `prettier`. We plan to introduce linter in the future.
